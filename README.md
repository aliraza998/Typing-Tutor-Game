# Typing-Tutor-Game
Typing games are a wonderful way to improve typing speed, focus and accuracy and can be tailored to current typing abilities.
This program not just only make the user amused by the game but also increases the typing speed of the user helping the user in real-life applications.

We developed a typing tutor in C Language only. Alphabets will be dropped down from the above of the screen and the user must type that letter before it hits the border at the bottom of the screen.

The number of letters will be increased resulting in the user typing in more letters quickly which may result in making the program faster and responsive also the user interface should be very much friendly to make the user play the game more efficiently and elongate the gaming experience.
